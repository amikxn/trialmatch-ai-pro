🎯 Problem Statement

Despite clinical trials offering access to cutting-edge treatments, only 2–5% of adult cancer patients participate in them.
Several systemic barriers drive this underutilization:

Manual, time-consuming trial matching workflows

Complex and inconsistent eligibility criteria

Lack of standardized patient-trial pairing tools

Limited awareness among both clinicians and patients
